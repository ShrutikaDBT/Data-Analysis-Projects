Power BI project

Heart Disease Data Analysis | SQL + Excel + Power BI
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes healthcare patient data to identify key risk factors associated with heart disease. The goal is to derive meaningful insights using SQL for querying, Excel for data validation, and Power BI for interactive visualization.

🎯 Objective

To identify patterns and risk indicators such as age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type that contribute to heart disease occurrence.

📊 Dataset Information

Source: Heart Disease Prediction Dataset

Total Records: 270

Target Variable: Heart Disease (Presence / Absence)

Attributes include age, sex, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, chest pain type, number of vessels, etc.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

MySQL → Data storage and SQL queries

Excel → Data cleaning and validation

Power BI → Data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard visualization

🔎 SQL Analysis Performed

Total patient count

Heart disease percentage calculation

Average cholesterol (Presence vs Absence)

Age group risk distribution

Chest pain type analysis

Gender-wise disease distribution

📈 Power BI Dashboard Features

KPI Cards (Total Patients, Heart Disease %, Max Risk Group)

Heart Disease by Age Group

Chest Pain Type Analysis

Gender Distribution

Interactive Filters (Sex, Age Group, Disease Status)

💡 Key Insights

44.44% of patients were diagnosed with heart disease

Highest risk observed in 40–60 age group

Chest pain type 4 shows strongest association with heart disease

Higher prevalence among male patients
